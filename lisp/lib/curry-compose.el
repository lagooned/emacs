;;; Commentary:

;; Leverages `lexical-binding: t' to define some neat higher order
;; functions and enables pretty print for them..

;;; Code:

(defsubst curry (function &rest arguments)
  (lexical-let ((function function)
                (arguments arguments))
    (lambda (&rest more) (apply function (append arguments more)))))

(defsubst rcurry (function &rest arguments)
  (lexical-let ((function function)
                (arguments arguments))
    (lambda (&rest more) (apply function (append more arguments)))))

(defsubst compose (function &rest more-functions)
  (cl-reduce (lambda (f g)
               (lexical-let ((f f) (g g))
                 (lambda (&rest arguments)
                   (funcall f (apply g arguments)))))
             more-functions
             :initial-value function))

(provide 'curry-compose)
;;; curry-compose.el ends here
