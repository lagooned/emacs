* disclaimer
- this is a personal config that i use all the time
  - master will change without warning as i find new things to add
  - fork if necessary
* install
- =git clone https://github.com/lagooned/emacs.git=
- =ln -s ./emacs ~/.emacs.d=
- =emacs &=
* usage
- evil-leader-key is SPC (much like spacemacs)
  - create env specific .custom.el by using SPC c . (default)
  - quit/restart with SPC q q and SPC q r (default)
- use which-key to explore functionality
- have fun :)
* future
- better way of managing keybinds
  - global keybinds conflict with evil philosophy
    - better way to unbindall that doesn't make emacs unusable if config breaks
  - convert evil-leader -> general.el
- find the best theme
  - probably impossible
